Roadmap
=======

In 2021 I plan for roughly monthly releases starting end of January and running to the end
of the year, with a 1.x release tentatively planned for start of 2022. *I strongly recommend
against use of live trading with real money on releases pre-1.x.* They will be unstable and
not as well tested, and the API's will be constantly changing.
