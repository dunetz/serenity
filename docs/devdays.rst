Developer Days
==============

Developer days are mini-hackathons and getting-started sessions for developers and
quant researchers interested in Serenity. They are ideal for those interested in
:doc:`contributing` or using Serenity for writing trading strategies. Note that the
Zoom sessions will be recorded and published after the Developer Day so others can
benefit if unable to attend.

Preparing
---------
* Fork the code on GitHub: https://github.com/cloudwall/serenity
* Install Serenity: :doc:`install`
* Read the quickstart guide: :doc:`quickstart`
* Prepare questions

Joining
-------
If you want to join a developer day you should first reach out to get the Zoom
password and a Slack channel invite. Send a PM to Kyle on LinkedIn or email if
interested to sign up, and be sure to introduce yourself and your areas of interest.

This ID will be used both for setting up in Azure DevOps (for contributors only) and
for granting you read-only access to the Behemoth tick datastore (for everyone).
